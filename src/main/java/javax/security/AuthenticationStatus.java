/**
 * The AuthenticationStatus is used as a return value by primarily
 * the {@link HttpAuthenticationMechanism} to indicate the result (status)
 * of the authentication process.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the result from {@link HttpAuthenticationMechanism#validateRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse, javax.security.authentication.mechanism.http.HttpMessageContext)} 
 * an AuthenticationStatus must be transformed by the Java EE server into the corresponding JASPIC (JSR 196) AuthStatus
 * according to the following rules:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li> AuthenticationStatus.NOT_DONE to AuthStatus.SUCCESS </li>
 *   <li> AuthenticationStatus.SEND_CONTINUE to AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE </li>
 *   <li> AuthenticationStatus.SUCCESS to AuthStatus.SUCCESS </li>
 *   <li> AuthenticationStatus.SEND_FAILURE to AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * After the transformation as outlined above the transformed result has to be processed by the Java EE server as 
 * specified by the Servlet Container Profile of the JASPIC 1.1 spec (chapter 3).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation note:</b> while the JASPIC Servlet Container Profile is the authoritative
 * source on how to process the <code>AuthStatus.SUCCESS</code> result and this specification puts no constraints 
 * of any kind on that, the expectation is that Java EE servers in practice will mainly look at the 
 * result being <code>AuthStatus.SUCCESS</code> or not <code>AuthStatus.SUCCESS</code>. Simply said, if the result is 
 * <code>AuthStatus.SUCCESS</code> the authenticated identity (if any) must be set (established) for the current HTTP request, 
 * otherwise not.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The return value of {@link SecurityContext#authenticate(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse, javax.security.authentication.mechanism.http.AuthenticationParameters)}
 * , which is also of type AuthenticationStatus, strongly relates to the outcome of the <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism#validateRequest</code>
 * method as described above, but must be transformed by the Java EE server from the corresponding outcome of the
 * {@link HttpServletRequest#authenticate(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse)} call as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li> <code>true</code> to <code>AuthenticationStatus.SUCCESS</code> </li>
 *   <li> <code>false</code> to <code>[last status]</code> (see below) </li>
 *   <li> <code>ServletException</code> or <code>IOException</code> to <code>AuthenticationStatus.SEND_FAILURE</code> </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When an <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> was used <code>[last status]</code> must be
 * the value returned by <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism#validateRequest</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a JASPIC ServerAuthModule (SAM) was used and an <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> was <em>not</em> used 
 * Java EE servers are encouraged, but not required, to set <code>[last status]</code> to the value returned by
 * <code>ServerAuthModule#validateRequest</code> transformed as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li> AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE to AuthenticationStatus.SEND_CONTINUE </li>
 *   <li> AuthStatus.SUCCESS to AuthenticationStatus.SUCCESS </li>
 *   <li> AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE to AuthenticationStatus.SEND_FAILURE </li>
 *   <li> (all other outcomes) to AuthenticationStatus.NOT_DONE </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a Java EE Server proprietary identity store equivalent was used and an 
 * <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> was <em>not</em> used 
 * Java EE servers are encouraged, but not required, to set <code>[last status]</code> to a value
 * that logically corresponds to the description of each enum constant of AuthenticationStatus. This outcome
 * should never be depended on by application code as being portable.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Application code calling <code>SecurityContext#authenticate</code> is expected to act on all possible
 * values of AuthenticationStatus.
